# Random U

> This project has two sections Home and Contact, the first one gives you a list of users, the second is a basic form.

> I use the [Random Users API](https://randomuser.me/) to take the users data.

> To make clean code I use eslint with prettier for the js and jsx. For the styles I use stylelint.
